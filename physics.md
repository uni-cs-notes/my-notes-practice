# coulombs law 
* statement:
            `coulombs law is a experimental law which calculate the amount of force between two electircally charged perticals at rest `
* the forces between the ` q1 & q2 ` are called the electrostatic force or coulombs force
*  the charge is represented by ` q `
* the law statement , ` the magnitude, or absolute value, of the attractive or repulsive electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of their charges and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them `

# electrical field 
* an electric field is basically the field area through which a charge have the ability to attract or repal another charged partical
* the concept of magetic and electric field is quite similar but the do differ in some aspests
# how electric field works
* to understand the phenomena of the electric field, first we have to understand what is a charge
## charge 
* a charge is the charge is:`a fundamental property of matter that determines how it interacts with electric and magnetic fields. There are two types of charge: positive and negative`
* the value of charge is `1.602×10−19 coulombs.` it is denoted by `q`
* charges are conserved means they can't be `created nor destoryed`
* they can only be `transferred from one object to another.`
## So the question arises how such a small object can emit such fields of attraction and repulsion?
* for that we have to understand the nature of charge
# nature of charges
* the charges are `negative (-) ,positive (+)`
* the positive charge `emits the fields rays outwards`
* the negative charge is opposite to of positive chrage
* the negative charge fields are `direction inwards` or towards the charge
# how they act when brought together!!
* the nature of both charges is different and their ability of attraction and repulsion as well
* the basic concept of how there forces are brought together are exactly based on their nature of emittion 
## Explanation
* The relationship between charges and electric fields is fundamental in electromagnetism. Charges create electric fields, which are regions of influence that emanate from charged particles into the surrounding space. Electric field lines move away from positive charges and towards negative ones. The electric field represents the force experienced by a unit charge placed in the vicinity of charged particles
* illustrate the relationship between charges and electric fields, consider a simple scenario with two oppositely charged balls: a small, positively charged ball and a larger, negatively charged ball. As these balls come closer to each other, their electric fields begin to overlap and interact. The electric field lines radiate outward from the positively charged ball and converge toward the negatively charged ball. In this case, the electric field strength increases as you get closer to either ball because the force acting upon a hypothetical positive test charge would grow stronger.
## what is test charge??
* A test charge is a point charge used to investigate the electric or magnetic fields in physics.
* Test charges play a crucial role in understanding and quantifying electric fields, allowing for the investigation of how charges interact and influence each other within a given space.
## Examples of utilizing test charges to understand electric fields include:

1. **Point charge in uniform electric field**: Imagine a single positive test charge placed in a uniform electric field caused by other charges. The test charge experiences a constant force in the direction of the electric field lines, enabling us to determine the electric field strength and direction.

2. **Charged spheres**: Consider two identical spheres, initially holding equal amounts of positive and negative charges. When one sphere acquires an additional positive charge by coming into proximity with a charged object, the negative charge on the other sphere moves towards the positively charged sphere, creating an imbalance of charges and an electric field between the spheres.

3. **Rubbed glass and silk**: Glass rubbed with silk gains a positive charge, while the silk obtains a negative charge. Separation of the glass and silk leads to an attractive force between them, as the positive and negative charges seek to recombine, forming an electric field.

These examples demonstrate how test charges help us analyze and visualize electric fields, thereby deepening our understanding of the relationships among charges, electric fields, and forces.

 # Electric flux
 * `Electric flux quantifies the electric field passing through a given surface, regardless of its size or shape.`
 * Electric flux is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism that measures the electric field passing through a given surface. It is defined as the dot product of the electric field and the area vector, representing the number of electric field lines crossing a surface. The electric flux through a surface is directly proportional to the total number of electric field lines passing through it.
# Gauss's law 
* `Gauss's law is a fundamental law in electromagnetism that relates the electric field to the electric charge it originates from. Here's a breakdown of the key ideas.`
## Formal Definition:

The law has two forms: integral and differential. The integral form relates the total electric flux passing through a closed surface (represented by the mathematical concept of divergence) to the enclosed charge. It's written as:

* `Φ = ∮ E • dA / ε₀`

Here, Φ is the electric flux, E is the electric field, dA is a tiny area element of the surface, and ε₀ (epsilon naught) is the permittivity of free space, a constant value.

## Applications:

Gauss's law is a powerful tool for solving problems in electrostatics because it allows us to calculate the electric field for certain symmetrical charge distributions without directly finding the forces between individual charges. This is particularly useful for situations with complex geometries.

For example, it can be used to determine the electric field of a uniformly charged sphere, a cylinder, or a plane sheet.

# Electric field of a uniformly charged sphere
* The electric field of a uniformly charged sphere depends on the location of the point of interest relative to the sphere. We can analyze it using Gauss's Law for three regions:

* Inside the sphere (r < R):
In this region, the electric field (E) is not uniform and varies with distance (r) from the center. Gauss's Law helps us derive the formula for E inside the sphere:
```
E = (Q * r) / (4πε₀R³)

Here,

Q is the total charge of the sphere
r is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of interest
R is the radius of the sphere
ε₀ (epsilon naught) is the permittivity of free space
```
* Interestingly, the electric field inside the sphere increases linearly with distance from the center and becomes zero at the center `(where r = 0)`.

* `On the surface of the sphere (r = R)`:
This is a special case where the value of E can be found by evaluating the expression for E inside the sphere at r = R.

* `Outside the sphere (r > R)`:
In this region, the electric field behaves as if `all the charge (Q)` were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Gauss's Law again helps us derive the formula for E outside the sphere:
```
E = Q / (4πε₀r²)
```
This equation is identical to the electric field formula for a point charge. So, the outside region experiences a uniform electric field radially outward, just like a point charge with the same total charge (Q).

* In summary, the electric field of a uniformly charged sphere has a distinct behavior in each of these three regions

  # application no:01 electric field intensity due to infinite sheet of charge
  1. Define Parameters:

Let's assume the surface charge density of the infinite sheet (σ) is +5 x 10^-9 C/m² (positive charge).
We'll use the permittivity of free space (ε₀) as its approximate value, 8.85 x 10^-12 C²/N∙m².
2. Choose Gaussian Surface:

Imagine a right cylinder with a radius of 0.1 meters (R = 0.1 m).
The length (L) doesn't affect the final result as long as it's large enough to encompass the region of interest.
3. Calculate Area of Flat Ends:

Area of each circular base (A) = π * R² = π * (0.1 m)² ≈ 0.0314 m²
4. Apply Gauss's Law:

We won't directly calculate the flux (E • dA) because it simplifies due to symmetry.

5. Consider Enclosed Charge:

The enclosed charge (Q) within the cylinder is due to the sheet and can be found by multiplying the surface charge density (σ) by the area (A) of one flat end:
Q = σ * A = (5 x 10^-9 C/m²) * (0.0314 m²) ≈ 1.57 x 10^-10 C

6. Solve for Electric Field:

Recall the formula derived from Gauss's Law:
E = σ / (2ε₀)

Plug in the values:
E = (+5 x 10^-9 C/m²) / (2 * 8.85 x 10^-12 C²/N∙m²) ≈ 2.83 x 10^2 N/C

7. Convert to Electric Field Intensity:

Electric field intensity (E) is measured in Volts/meter (V/m). We need to convert the force per unit charge (N/C) to V/m:
E = (2.83 x 10^2 N/C) * (1 V/1 N) ≈ 2.83 x 10^2 V/m

Interpretation:

The electric field intensity due to the infinite sheet of charge with a positive surface charge density of +5 x 10^-9 C/m² is approximately 2.83 x 10^2 V/m, directed away from the sheet as expected.

Note: This is a simplified example. You can adjust the values of σ and R based on your specific problem.
